TPS 1
1. 0x00400000 is text segment, data segment 0x10010000
2. basic show the command in machine language while sources gets it from mips language. the only difference is that the variables/ registers have different names
3. 32 bits
4. 8 collumns
5. each collumn could hold 4 bits 
6. m:	.word 20
7. 0x10010000
8. str1: .asciiz "I love CSE31!"
9. 268468224
10. done
11. done
12. Loads address of n to $t3. lw loads the word from where t3 points to t3.
