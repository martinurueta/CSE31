TPS 1
1. this printed out the hex number of 2 to be 2 because hex is based 16 (0-F)
2. I believe it will print out capital A or 0x41
3. I was incorrect that its input is 44434241  this printed DCBA in hex
4. it prints 2 and surprise
5. 
    a. 2 array were allocated in this program
    b. they are not pointed in the same direction
    c. four_int[0] is point to four_c
6. there is 4 bits allocated in each int array
7. done(drawing)
8. I see that four_c is under the 1 bit of int array of index 0
9. done(drawing)
10. so we have to access memory if we want to make a malloc 2d arrays or even 3d if we want to

TPS 2
1. line 8 adds add more rows of that 1d array to make it 2d
2. we would do *(arr + i) to access the values of the array
3. we would do *(*(arr + i) + j) to access the values of a 2d array
4. we need to output the size so we can print all of nxn array
5. done
6. done
7. done
