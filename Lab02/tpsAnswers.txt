TPS2:
1. cc -g punishment.c -o punish
2. gdb ./punish.out
3. use "run"
4. "break [filename]:[linenumber]"
5. next
6. you just do p and what ever the variable name is
7. call it next until finish
8. q for quit

TPS3:
1. there are 4 variables and there are 2 pointers that are named as pointers for x and y
2. it shoots random numbers
3. having them point to something and having a number that arr can hold
8. This result kinda make sense because there is an adress in each block of the array, it save a part of it in the array like 4bytes of adress
question 4-7 answered through pointers.c
