Input: X(any number from user)
Output: Even Average and Odd Average (if it is not equal to zero)

while (X does not equal 0){
    split up the value
        X mod 10 (to get the single digit)
        Xadd = X;
        X = X / 10(to reduce place digit)

        if Xadd == even (Xadd % 2 == 0){
            even Average = X;
        }else{
            Odd Average = X
        }
        even Average = even Average / number of while looping for even
        odd Average = odd Average / number of while looping for odd
        print even
        print odd
        if their zero
            print no compute
